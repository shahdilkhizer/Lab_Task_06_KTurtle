Turtle Graphics Application
A simple Java console application that uses a "turtle" to draw shapes on a graphical canvas. You can either choose from built-in shapes or create your own custom designs by providing commands.
```
Features
Built-in Shapes: Draw pre-defined shapes like a square or a zig-zag pattern.

Custom Commands: Create your own drawings by using a sequence of commands.

F: Move the turtle forward.

+: Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right.

-: Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the left.

Graphical Interface: The application uses a JFrame to display the canvas and the resulting drawings.
