Turtle Graphics Drawing App
This is a Java Swing-based Turtle Graphics application that allows you to draw shapes on a canvas using either built-in commands (like Square and ZigZag) or custom commands (e.g., F+F+F-F).
It demonstrates object-oriented programming, command pattern, and 2D graphics rendering in Java.

How It Works
Main Entry Point

Main.java runs the program by calling new App().run().

App Initialization

Creates a JFrame with a Canvas to draw lines.

Initializes a Turtle object that can move and turn on the canvas.

Loads available commands (Square, ZigZag).

User Choices

Option 1: Choose from built-in shapes.

Option 2: Enter a custom command string like:

r
Copy
Edit
F+F+F+F
F â†’ Move forward

+ â†’ Turn right 90Â°

- â†’ Turn left 90Â°

Drawing

The Turtle moves based on commands, drawing lines on the canvas using Pen and Canvas.

ðŸ›  Key Classes
Turtle: Extends Pen, moves and draws lines based on direction and step size.

Canvas: A JPanel that stores and renders drawn lines.

Command Interface: Defines a contract for shape commands.

CommandParser: Reads custom strings and controls the turtle.

SquareCommand / ZigZagCommand: Example built-in shapes.
